# Quality Control in preclinical MRI: Where do artifacts come from and how to fix them

## Synopsis
This talk will introduce
additional considerations for
quality assurance in small
animal MRI. For instance, we
have anecdotally found that
equipment for stabilising
physiology under anaesthetic
protocols can impact image
quality, particularly air
heaters. There are further
considerations to make after
the completion of each image
processing step, as many
software tools are designed
for humans and have implicit
voxel size/shape/contrast
assumptions that are not
valid for rodents. The tutorial
will highlight where in the
processing pipeline these are
most likely to arise, examples
of these degraded results,
and suggestions to mitigate
them. Finally, we will frame
these problems in the context
of our experience extending
MRIQC and fMRIPrep for
rodents, to conclude with an
interactive session where the
participants will be
challenged with identifying
quality issues on a set of
images that conform a
“gallery of horrors,” which we
will build by gathering
examples showing artifacts
and quality issues from in-house databases, open
datasets, and examples
provided by the community.
The tutorial will demonstrate
the utility of the visual reports
MRIQC generates to identify
quality issues on preclinical
MRI data.
