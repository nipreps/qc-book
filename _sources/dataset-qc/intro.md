# Dataset QC: Taking control of your data

## Synopsis

We will begin this session by
giving an introduction on the
quality issues in MRI, and
how these can be addressed
by the use of pipelines and
scripts for efficient
preprocessing and analysis
of the data. Sharing her
experience of working on the
Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control (DMCC) project ([Etzel et al., Scientific Data 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01226-4)), Jo will then present
certain QC/QA procedures,
analysis approaches, and
software practices that she
has found most beneficial
(using tools such as R and
fMRIprep). Dynamic reports
(e.g., knitr, markdown)
should be used for analyses
whenever possible, so that
images, results, source code,
and discussion are together.
This is especially important to
share with published papers,
to enable readers to
reproduce the results and
see the parameters. The
audience will learn to extend
these best practices to their
own dataset through the
interactive tutorials that will
follow which will use tools
such as knitr and markdown.
These tools facilitate the
generation of dynamic
reports for analyses which
ensures that images, results,
source code and discussions
are in one place.
