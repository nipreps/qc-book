```{python}
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

mpl.rcParams["font.family"] = "Libre Franklin"
plt.rcParams["axes.facecolor"] = "white"
plt.rcParams["savefig.facecolor"] = "white"

# Load the data as we did previously
from mriqc_learn.datasets import load_dataset
(train_x, train_y), _ = load_dataset(split_strategy="none")
```

# Target labels: manual ratings by humans
Let's go further in exploring this effect, by now focusing our attention on the dataset targets (`train_y`).

```{python}
from mriqc_learn.viz import ratings
ratings.raters_variability_plot(train_y);
```
